## Types of languages
* There are two types of laguages:
1. Strongly typed Language 
2. loosely typed language

## Strongly typed vs loosely typed
* The terms strongly typed and loosely typed refer to how programming languages handle types, particularly how strict they are about type conversions and type safety.
### Strongly typed languages
- Examples - Java, C++, C, Rust
- Benefits - Lesser runtime errors, Stricter codebase, Easy to catch errors at compile time
### Loosely typed languages
- Examples - Python, Javascript, Perl, php
- Benefits - Easy to write code, Fast to bootstrap, Low learning curve

* Note- People realised that javascript is a very power language, but lacks types.


# What is typescript ?
* TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. 
* It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

## Where/How does typescript code run ?
* Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javascript. 
1. Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/nodejs runtime)
2. Typescript is something that compiles down to javascript
3. When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking (similar to C++). If there is an error, the conversion to Javascript fails.

### Typescript compiler
* tsc is the official typescript compiler that you can use to convert Typescript code into Javascript
* There are many other famous compilers/transpilers for converting Typescript to Javascript. Some famous ones are - 
1. esbuild
2. swc

## How to install Typescript Node.js application locally on our machines ?
1. npm install -g typescript
2. npm init -y &  npx tsc --init 

. This is the high level benefit of typescript. It lets you catch type errors at compile time

# Basic Types in TypeScript
* Typescript provides you some basic types number, string, boolean, null, undefined, any.

# Interfaces
##  What are interfaces ?
* How can you assign types to objects? For example, a user object that looks like this - 
```.js
const user = {
	firstName: "harkirat",
	lastName: "singh",
	email: "email@gmail.com".
	age: 21,
}
```
To assign a type to the user object, you can use interfaces
```.ts
interface User {
	firstName: string;
	lastName: string;
	email: string;
	age: number;
}
```
#### Task - Create a React component that takes todos as an input and renders them
```.js
// Todo.tsx
interface TodoType {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    done: boolean;
  }
  
  interface TodoInput {
    todo: TodoType;
  }
  
  function Todo({ todo }: TodoInput) {
    return <div>
      <h1>{todo.title}</h1>
      <h2>{todo.description}</h2>
      
    </div>
  }
```

# Types
## What are types ?
* Very similar to interfaces , types let you aggregate data together.
```.ts
type User = {
	firstName: string;
	lastName: string;
	age: number
}

```

# Arrays in TS
* If you want to access arrays in typescript, itâ€™s as simple as adding a [] annotation next to the type

# ENUMS in TS
* Enums (short for enumerations) in TypeScript are a feature that allows you to define a set of named constants.
* The concept behind an enumeration is to create a human-readable way to represent a set of constant values, which might otherwise be represented as numbers or strings.
